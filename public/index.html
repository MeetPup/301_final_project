              <p class="bio">Abigail White was born on March 26, 1985, in London, England. She made her film debut at the age of 9 in A Village Affair (1994). Her first major part came in Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace and she then became well-known for her performance as tomboy footballer Juliette "Jules" Paxton in Bend It Like Beckham. Her later films include Atonement, Pirates of the Caribbean, A Dangerous Method and Anna Karenina. She has also earned Oscar nominations for her roles in Pride and Prejudice and The Imitation Game.</p>

              <p class="bio">Hobbes is a fun-loving Maltese who spreads his Joy at every opportunity. He has been in love exactly one time with a small pup named Lily, until her family tragically moved away. Although Hobbes has never fully recovered, he has found purpose in other meaningful pursuits, such as running around in circles. He loves belly rubs and tug-a-war and sweet potato for dinner (stovetop cooked, not microwaved). Someday he hopes to catch a squirrel or a cat or something, even though he's not sure what he would do with it if he did.</p>

              <p class="bio">Originally from Issaquah, WA, Kaylee was first introduced to coding during her freshman year of college. She ultimately decided that a four-year university wasn't for her, so she signed up for a JavaScript 101 course at Code Fellows and hasn't looked back since. Once she finishes her education, she hopes to land a job as a junior full-stack JS developer in San Francisco.</p>

              <p class="bio">Joe-Joe hails from Idaho, and <em>loves</em> being treated like the prince that he is. He'll go for the occasional walk, but he mostly enjoys lying around on the couch, getting his tummy rubbed, or eating roast chicken. Squirrels and men wearing hats are his only nemeses-- other than that, he's a lover, not a fighter.</p>
