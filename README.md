[![Link to MeetPup website ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeetPup/301_final_project/master/public/images/logo/Logo-large.png)](http://meetpupevents.herokuapp.com/)

Have you ever wondered what local pup groups are out there? Perhaps a frolic in a field with some furry friends? Maybe a rambunctious romp or a playful pup parent group? By supplying only a zip code, MeetPup will direct you to local pet events within a 20 mile radius, visually represented on a map!

The search results provide information regarding:
* Title of the event
* Link to the event Meetup page
* Date and time of the event
* Distance to the event
* Name of organization group
* Link to organizing group's Meetup page

##User Stories
