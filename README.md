##Code Fellows 301 Final Project: MEETPUP

![alt text](public/images/Logo-large.png) [MeetPup Website](http://meetpupevents.herokuapp.com/)

Have you ever wondered what local pup groups are out there? Perhaps a frolic in a field with some furry friends? Maybe a rambunctious romp or a playful pup parent group? By supplying only a zip code, MeetPup will direct you to local pet events within a 20 mile radius, visually represented on a map!

The search results provide information regarding:
* Title of the event
* Link to the event MeetUp page
* Date and time of the event
* Distance to the event
* Name of organization group
* Link to organizing group's MeetUp page

##User Stories

###User:
* As a user, I want to locate pet-related events in my local area within a month of the query.
* As a user, I want to click on the location of each event to retrieve relevant information about that event.
* As a user, I want the views to be intuitive and easy to move between


###Developer:
* As a developer, I want to have the user experience be nice so that they will visit my site again.
* As a developer, I want to achieve MVP in an orderly fashion to accomplish my project by presentation day.
* As a developer, I want to have a visual experience that is nice so that future employers are not worried about hiring me.
